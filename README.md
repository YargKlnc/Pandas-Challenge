# Pandas-Challenge 
UofT Data Analytics Bootcamp Assignment 4, Pandas Challenge by YK

In this assignment, **Pandas DataFrames created and manipulated** to analyze school and standardized test data that will help strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
The district-wide standardized test results were analyzed with access to every student's math and reading scores **to showcase obvious trends in school performance.**
**District summary** was created to obtain a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame and **school summary** to get a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school besides **Highest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing, Lowest-Performing Schools by Percentage of Overall Passing, Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, Scores by School Type**.
**A written report** was created to summarize the analysis and to draw two conclusions from the calculations.
